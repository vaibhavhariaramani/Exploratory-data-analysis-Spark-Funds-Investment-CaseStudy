# Exploratory data analysis(E.D.A.)-Investment-Case Study
Spark Funds - asset management


## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

We will explore a Data set and perform the exploratory data analysis. The major topics to be covered are below:

- Handle Missing value
- Removing duplicates
- Outlier Treatment
- Normalizing and Scaling( Numerical Variables)
- Encoding Categorical variables( Dummy Variables)
- Bivariate Analysis

## Project Brief
Our work for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

# objectives
The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'. (Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.)
 
## 1. What is the strategy?

[companies](https://github.com/vaibhavhariaramani/Spark-Funds-Investment-CaseStudy/blob/master/companies.txt): A table with basic data of companies
[rounds2](https://github.com/vaibhavhariaramani/Spark-Funds-Investment-CaseStudy/blob/master/rounds2.csv): Funding round details
[mapping.csv](https://github.com/vaibhavhariaramani/Spark-Funds-Investment-CaseStudy/blob/master/mapping.csv): This file maps the numerous category names in the companies table (such 3D printing, aerospace, agriculture, etc.) to eight broad sector names. The purpose is to simplify the analysis into eight sector buckets, rather than trying to analyse hundreds of them.
